# FrozenLakeMDP
A quick re-impl of frozen lake made for value iteration/policy iteration methods.

- If you would like to increase the size of the map, look into `N`.

- If you want to set the map the module will run, make your own list of `N`-length strings,
and set the `MAP` variable equal to your custom map.

- If you want the frozenlake actions to be stochastic when learning the value function,
pass in `stochasticity` keyword. Stochasticity of 1 means completely random movements.

Enjoy!
